Documentation
-------------
LibVMI has begun a documentation effort to provide high quality information
regarding the installation, configuration, and use of the library. Check
back here for updated documentation, which will be posted as it is completed.

If you would like to help work on this documentation effort, please
[contact][contact] us and we'll put you to work!
